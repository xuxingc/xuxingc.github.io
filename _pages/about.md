Hello, I am a research scientist at Meta. I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at University of California Davis in 2024, advised by [Prof. Krishnakumar Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/) and [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://sqma.rice.edu/). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China in 2020. My research interest is in the mathematics of data science, with a focus on the interface of optimization and machine learning.
